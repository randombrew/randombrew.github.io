So there is a new bill on DNA tech that is being discussed in the Indian parliament. Check this podcast to learn more about it: [DNA tech](https://www.thinkpragati.com/podcast/the-pragati-podcast/8019/india-dna-bill-2019/ "Think Pragati")

Ever since hearing about startups like 23andme and Ancestry, I have been wanting to sequence my DNA, I even looked up the pricing for it. Now with this new bill coming into picture, if my DNA will be indexed into a database, then maybe I am not that excited about sequencing my DNA.
