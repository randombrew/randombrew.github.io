They call him the Dude and he was invited everybody to his party. It is lavish party, the Dude is pretty generous they say. Apparently everything is in abundance - enough Kombucha and yogurt for you and me, the Dude is pretty probiotic.

Then something went wrong, suddenly the peeps in the party started behaving weird. They seemed to think that this party is going to end and that the Dude may not be as generous as they thought he was. They say a story of a apple and a snake, now I am not sure what that means but the gist is that people starting thinking that this party is ending and all man to himself.

People are stacking up their pies, there fights for Kombucha much hustle for those yogurt. The fight is turning ugly. Suddenly I see a murder - A farmer killed a shepherd. I see twins flighting for some red stew, 11 brothers conspiring to kill their hip brother. This is just getting mad.

Suddenly I hear that the Dude has called out one of guest to show the the entire party that he is a generous host and that their enough. It seems like the Dude is giving that person something special, is that favoritism ? - I wonder, but then he has it seems that the Dude would want to show the whole party that he is good host through people partying themselves, almost as if he doesn't want to step in the scene.

Turns out at every instance of time he is picking a few people to show that he is a good host and that he really want the people to enjoy and not be weary of the party, but the party has gone so violent that they keeping killing or hurting these chosen guests. They are just trying to show that the Dude is a good guy and that there is enough and more for everybody.

There is more to this story, but I wonder how would it look like to party harder in this grand party battling the accepted notion that this party is not as lavish as I think and that the Dude is not as good as they say. Maybe the Dude himself has to do something about it. In some sense all the chosen guests were pointing to the Dude himself, if we never listen to them, will we listen to the Dude himself, or maybe did the Dude already came by and we missed him to be just another chosen guests.
